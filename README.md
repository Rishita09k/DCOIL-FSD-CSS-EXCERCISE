CSS Exercises to practice what we have learned in the class 


How To Use These Exercises
Fork and clone this repository. To learn how to fork a repository, see the GitHub documentation on how to fork a repo.
Copies of repositories on your machine are called clones. If you need help cloning to your local environment, you can learn how from the GitHub documentation on cloning a repository.
Go to an exercise directory and open the HTML file in a web browser. You can open the file directly or use something like VSCode's Live Server extension.
For each exercise, read the README thoroughly before starting any work.
Each README has a "Self Check" list. Use this to ensure you haven't missed any important details in your implementation.
Make your edits in the index.html and/or the style.css files in order to make the output in your browser look like the Desired Outcome image(s).
Depending on the instructions of the exercise, you may only need to make edits in one of these files.
